            <p>Here is link to the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/cubequest/">CU-E3 official webpage</a>.</p>

            <p>CU-Earth Escape Explorer ("CU-E3") is the University of Colorado of Boulder's student-driven effort to design, build, and launch a CubeSat capable of long-distance communications into heliocentric orbit as part of the <span class="yellow">NASA CubeQuest: Deep-Space Derby</span>. This Challenge is sponsored by NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate Centennial Challenge Program and offers monetary incentive to teams that are innovative in meeting specific guidelines set by NASA's CubeQuest Challenge. This is not limited to university students. To learn more visit <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/cubequest/about.html">NASA's CubeQuest webpage</a>.</p> 

            <p>The CubeQuest challenge consists of two sections:<br>
            Ground Tournaments (GT)
                <ul>
                    <li>Assesses team concept maturity and probability of success</li>
                    <li>Top 5 at each GT win <span class="yellow">prize money</span> (20k for GT-1&amp;4, 30k for GT-2&amp;3)</li>
                    <li>Top 3 at GT 4 are guaranteed a launch slot on EM-1, with a possibility of 3 other slots being filled by the competition</li>
                </ul>
                Deep Space Derby            
                <ul>
                    <li>Place a CubeSat into <span class="yellow">deep space</span></li>
                    <li>Communicate with Earth from <span class="yellow">4-million kilometers</span> and beyond.</li>
                    <li>Incentivizes <span class="yellow">new communications architecture</span></li>
                    <li>CubeSat needs to last for <span class="yellow">1 year</span> after launch</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
